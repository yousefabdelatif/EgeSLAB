# EgeSLAB
simple logging and benchmarking library 
# what the library can do:
for now it can print :
  1-print the function name 
  2-the file where you have put this function ,
  3-the line in which the the function have been called 
  4-how much time did it take .



# to use it 
the library is just one header ,so you can just ctrl+c ctrl+v it in your projects :)
type  StartRecording(); in the first line of the function then type  EndRecording() at the end of the function.
the output look like this 
   " Function : " main " in line ( 10 ) in "GameEntryPoint.cpp" took [ 1.01595s ] "
